we have to make a simple application with morderen professional ui, it should take 2 files as input like the files attached,

context:
so the company has multiple vendors we have to find total invoice for each


strcuture:
1) sheet 1 (universal database): this has 3 columns: supplier, default pay, invoice total. your goal as the agent is to make code for taking content from "The Maxwell hotel" sheet. 
and filling up the column for invoice tool in (universal database).
2) sheet 2 (The Maxwell hotel): the columns are Vendor,	Invoice Amount. 

process:
1) first take "The Maxwell hotel", for a vendor id there will be a small table made with vendor name
2) match the vendor name with the supplier name in the universal database
   a) exact match: if there is an exact match 
   b) if there is no exact match do fuzzy matching
3) now when the matching is done in the col for Invoice Amount there will be a subsum total given for that vendor take that ammount and add it to the invoice total col in sheet 1
